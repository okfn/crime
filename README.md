Dashboard giving overview of UK Crime including map and trends.

## Plan

What do you want to see?

* All crime in a given area (at a given time of a given type?)

  * More info on a given crime

* Crime trends? Per month, per region, per year
* Breakdown: bubbletree (region => crime type and vice versa)

  * Per capita is important

### Long-term

Work generically with data from different sources (common CSV).
